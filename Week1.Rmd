```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

Our first experience with R markdown. We use code `chunks` to run `R` code.

```{r}
## Load packages
## install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
earnings <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feb-uni-sofia/econometrics2021/main/data/earnings.csv")
```

What is in the data frame (table)?

```{r}
glimpse(earnings)
```
The data frame contains 15 variables (columns) and 1816 observations (rows). The observations here are persons.

```{r}
1 / 3
NA ## Missing data value
```

## Descriptive summaries

### Height

```{r}
mean(earnings$height)
```
Average height of the persons in the survey was 66.56 inches.
