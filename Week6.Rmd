## Cholera outbreak

[Jon Snow](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Jon_Snow) is a character from George R. R. Martin's "Fire and Ice" novel who fought the Night King and helped bring peace to Westeros.

[John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) was an English physicist famous for locating the source of the London cholera epidemic of 1854. At the time of the outbreak the germ theory of disease transmission was not developed yet and cholera was blamed on bad air. John Snow investigated the cases and concluded that the source of the outbreak is a water pump located on Broad Street. He was able to convince the city council to close the pump but people initially resisted his theory of water born transmission, because it seemed to be socially unacceptable.

## World War II

During World war 2 combat aviation played a crucial role but also suffered heavy casualties. British bomber command for example reports a death rate of about 46 percent over the entire war. In order to reduce the number of planes that were being shot down during mission, the military collected data on the damage taken from returning bombers in order to decide where to place armour on the planes.

# Two continuous predictors

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

crime <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feb-uni-sofia/econometrics2020-solutions/master/data/crime.csv") %>%
  select(-I)
```

Variables description:

- `C`: number of crimes per 100,000 inhabitants
- `HS`: share of high school graduates
- `U`: share of persons living in urban areas


```{r}
## Code for illustration purposes only

us_counties <- map_data("county")
florida_counties <- us_counties %>%
  filter(region == "florida")

crime_match <- crime %>%
  mutate(
    County = str_to_lower(str_replace_all(County, "\\.", ""))
  )

county_name_compat <- c(
  "washington" = "washing",
  "santa rosa" = "santar",
  "suwannee" = "suwanee",
  "palm beach" = "palmb",
  "okeechobee" = "okeech",
  "indian river" = "indianr",
  "hillsborough" = "hillsbor",
  "miami-dade" = "dade"
)

florida_crime <- florida_counties %>%
  mutate(
    County = dplyr::recode(subregion, !!!county_name_compat),
    County = str_replace_all(County, "\\s", "")
  ) %>%
  left_join(crime_match, by = "County")

p1 <- florida_crime %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = U)) +
  geom_polygon()

p2 <- florida_crime %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = HS)) +
  geom_polygon()
p1 + p2
```


$$
\underbrace{C_i}_{Crime} = \alpha + \beta \underbrace{\text{HS}_i}_{\text{Share of persons with high school degree}} + e_i
$$


```{r}
fit <- lm(C ~ HS, data = crime)
summary(fit)
```

Estimated equation:

$\hat{C}$: expected crime rate


$$
\hat{C}_i = -50.8 + 1.48 \text{HS}_i
$$

$$
\hat{C}_i[\text{number of crimes}] = -50.8[\text{number of crimes}] + 1.48 \left[\frac{\text{number of crimes}}{\text{percentage points}}\right]\text{HS}_i[\text{percentage points}]
$$


$$
\hat{C}_{HS = 80}  = -50.8 + 1.48 \times 80\\
\hat{C}_{HS = 79}  = -50.8 + 1.48 \times 79\\
\hat{C}_{HS = 80} - \hat{C}_{HS = 79} = -50.8 + 1.48 \times 80 - (-50.8 + 1.48 \times 79) = 1.48\times(80 - 79) = 1.48
$$



Interpretation (slope): comparing two counties: that differ by 1 percentage point on HS we expect the county with the higher HS to have 1.48 crimes more for 100,000 inhabitants.

Interpretation (intercept):

$$
\hat{C}_{HS} = -50.8 + 1.48 HS\\
\hat{C}_{HS = 0} = -50.8
$$

$$
f(x) = -50.8 + 1.48x\\
f(0) = -50.8
$$

$$
\overline{HS} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} HS_i\\
C_i = \alpha + \beta (\text{HS}_i - \overline{HS}) + e_i\\
$$
```{r}
crime %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = HS, y = C)) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    geom_abline(intercept = -50.8, slope = 1.48) +
    labs(
      x = "HS: Percentage of persons with high school degree",
      y = "C: Crime rate"
    ) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(55, 60, 70, 80, 85)) +
    xlim(c(0, 90)) +
    ylim(c(-55, 140))  +
     geom_vline(xintercept = 0, lty = 2) +
     geom_vline(xintercept = 69.49, lty = 2)
```

```{r}
## Average value of HS: 69.48 percent
mean(crime$HS)

crime <- crime %>%
  mutate(
    HS_centered = HS - mean(HS)
  )
```

```{r}
fit_HS_centered <- lm(C ~ HS_centered, data = crime)
summary(fit_HS_centered)

# summary(crime$HS)
# summary(crime$HS_centered)
```

$$
\hat{C}_i = 52.4 + 1.48 (HS_i - \overline{HS})\\
\hat{C}_i = 52.4 + 1.48 (HS_i - 69.48)\\
$$

$$
\hat{C}_{HS = \overline{HS}} = 52.4
$$
Expected crime rate in a county with the average share of high school graduates.


$$
\underbrace{C_i}_{Crime} = \alpha + \beta \underbrace{\text{U}_i}_{\text{Share of persons in urban areas}} + e_i
$$

Predictions:

```{r}
## Prediction with the original model C ~ HS
newdata_hs0 <- data.frame(HS = 0)
# ?predict.lm
predict(fit, newdata = newdata_hs0, se.fit = TRUE)
```

$$
\hat{C}_{HS} = -50.85 + 1.48 HS\\
\hat{C}_{HS = 0} = -50.85
$$


```{r}
## Average HS = 69.49
predict(fit, newdata = data.frame(HS = 69.49), se.fit = TRUE)
```

$$
\hat{C}_{HS = \overline{HS}} = 52.40365
$$

```{r}
newdata_multiple_values <- data.frame(HS = c(40, 50, 69, 80, 100))
# newdata_multiple_values <- data.frame(HS = c(69))
predict(fit, newdata = newdata_multiple_values, se.fit = TRUE, interval = "confidence")
```

$$
\hat{C}_{HS = 100} = 97.74081
$$


```{r}
fit_U <- lm(C ~ U, data = crime)
summary(fit_U)
```

$$
\hat{C}_i = 24.5 + 0.56 U_i
$$

Interpretation: counties that differ by one percentage point (the unit of U) on U are expected to differ by 0.56 cimes per 100,000 inhabitants. Counties with higher degree of urbanisation are expected to have higher crime rates.


```{r}
crime %>%
  select(C, HS, U) %>%
  pairs()
```



$$
C_i = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{HS}_i  + \beta_2 \text{U}_i + e_i
$$

```{r}
fit_U_HS <- lm(C ~ HS + U, data = crime)
summary(fit_U_HS)
```

```{r}
 
```

$$
\hat{C}_i = 59.1 -0.58 \text{HS}_i  + 0.68 \text{U}_i
$$
